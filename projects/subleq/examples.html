         >This program copies the message defined in the code to another address. In the first line of the program the computer jumps to the label 'start' to avoid executing the string defined below
         as instructions. The extra zero after the message is later used to determine the end of the string. Under the label 'start' the start address of the message and the destination address, which
         in this case is the base address of the heap, are stored in the two registers A and B. Next, the instructions under the label 'loop' are executed. At first, the data to which register A
         points (pointer, therefore [...]), which is the current character, is moved to the address to which register B points to. Then A and B are incremented by one to move the pointers to the next
         character of the message and to the next output position. Now it is checked if the current character is zero to determine if the message has been completely copied. If that's the case, the
         computer jumps to the label 'end' which halts the program. Otherwise the computer jumps back to 'loop' and starts all over again with the next character.</t

      <t class="text"
         >This program calculates all the prime numbers from zero up to the defined maximum and stores them in the output address, which in this case is the heap. To understand this program, one needs
         to know that any non-prime number is divisible by a smaller prime number. So knowing the second prime number 3 (for convenience) we can calculate all the following prime numbers by checking
         if the current number is divisible by any prime number smaller than the number we are checking. This program has the following structure: Every odd number from 3 on is checked if it is prime
         by calculating the modulo of the number and every already calculated prime number. If one of those moduli is equal to zero, the number is evenly divisible by a prime number and can therefore
         not be a prime number. In that case the loop can be broken and the program moves to the next number. But if the program reached the last prime number without any modulo being zero, the number
         has to be a prime and it is moved to the output.</t

      <t class="title">Fibonacci Sequence</t><br />
      <t class="text"
         >This program calculates all the elements of the fibonacci sequence up to the defined maximum. The fibonacci sequence starts with two ones with the next element always being the sum of the
         previous two elements. So it goes like: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... An interesting fact is that the bigger the numbers are getting, the closer the ratio of two neighbouring elements
         approaches the golden ratio. If you run this program after assembling it to machine language in the subleq emulator, make sure to set 'Base' to 10 to see the result in decimal. In the first
         line of the program the assembler instruction defines the maximum of 1000. Then the macro 'addt' for adding two numbers and storing the result at a different address is defined. While this is
         not absolutely neccessary, it makes the code more readable and easier to expand. The main program starts by moving the base of the output, in this case the heap, to register A. The first two
         elements of the fibonacci sequence, 1 and 1, are stored in registers B and C. The next four instructions manually copy them to the output. Under the label 'loopstart' registers B and C are
         added with the result being stored in register D. Next it is checked if the result is larger or equal to the defined maximum and if yes, it jumps to the label 'end' to halt the program. Or it
         continues if the result is still less than the maximum. The next two instructions set the new B and C by setting B to C and C to the new result D. Then the result is copied to the output and
         the loop starts all over again.</t
